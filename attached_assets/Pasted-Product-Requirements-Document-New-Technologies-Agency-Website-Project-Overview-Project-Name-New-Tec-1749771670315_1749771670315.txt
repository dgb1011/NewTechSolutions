Typography Design Principles:

Generous line spacing (1.6-1.8) for enhanced readability
Strategic use of font weight contrast within single headlines
Subtle letter spacing adjustments for premium feel
Consistent hierarchy with clear visual relationships
White space utilization for sophisticated typography presentation

5.3 Animation Guidelines (Minimal & Sophisticated)
Micro-Interactions (Refined Approach):

Button hover effects: 0.3s ease-out with subtle background opacity changes
Navigation links: 0.2s color transitions from white/80 to white/100
CTA buttons: Gentle scale (1.02x) and opacity shifts
Form field focus: 0.2s ease-out with subtle border glow
Loading states: Minimal, elegant progress indicators

Background Animations:

3D scene elements: Slow, continuous movement (0.5-1 RPM)
Particle systems: Gentle floating motion with opacity variations
Glassmorphism effects: Subtle blur and transparency shifts
Geometric shapes: Smooth rotation and morphing transformations

Page Transitions (Elegant & Seamless):

Route changes: 0.4s fade transitions with slight vertical offset
Section reveals: Staggered opacity animations (0.6s duration)
Scroll-triggered: Intersection-based with easing curves
Modal/overlay appearances: Scale and fade combinations

Layout Animations:

Content containers: Gentle slide-up animations on viewport entry
Grid items: Staggered appearance with 0.1s delays
Statistics/metrics: Count-up animations with easing
Image reveals: Subtle scale and opacity transitions

Design Philosophy for Motion:

Prioritize subtlety over dramatic effects
Use opacity and scale transforms primarily
Implement smooth easing curves (cubic-bezier)
Maintain consistent timing across similar elements
Ensure animations enhance rather than distract from content
